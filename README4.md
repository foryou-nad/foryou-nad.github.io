# Ch 4

I wrote this the morning after i write chapter 3

And at the time that i typed all this, it was 14:16 on July 6 2023

Ok where should i start?

On July 6 Morning at 6 am, she sent me a reel, with an extra message that im not gonnna say for now because of security reasons, but i was genuinely confused and at the same time i was thinking that im just hallucinating because i just woke up at 7.

But then i realized that its a real message from her, i was so so happy and i didnt expect her to dm me first instead of me first dming her. But i still manage to control my emotions and im trying to be professional as ever,to not reply it on the first 10 minutes or maybe 2 hours, why?, because i dont want to hope too much on her, like i did previously. 


But yeah thats basically it for her.

I am now trying to get a job, yes i know it might sound impossible especially because of my current age and my laptop that didnt really support heavy things, but i found a website for freelancing where someone can basically create some sort of auction, and the freelancer can bid for the salary and do the project. Now i see this as an opportunity but i just realize that its not as easy as it sounds, because it needs highly programming skills to do all of those shit, though some of them doesnt need as much as i thought it would be, but the bidders/freelancer are a lot, and i cant just compete with them in under 7 days because of the deadline.


So yeah, im still searching for a job.

thats it, its pretty short i know but i dont know what to type anymore, probably this cat


jk i cant.
