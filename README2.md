Haha, this is becoming something like a diary, but idgaf anyway

You wanna know why i named this repo like that?

Yeah! for her! what a fucking idiot right? who would do anything just for someone that didnt even love us back, who?? you guessed it! ME! LOL

In the future i'll probably change this to something else, but for now im still gonna keep it this way, to show other people my efforts and that im not just some kind of idiot who simps for the friendliest girl in my school smh. 
Probably gonna change it maybe 1-2 weeks on school after summer, k letss not talk about her now, this time i wanna talk about my friend, not just friend, but someone that i consider as my big sis figure for me, and my 3 other friends, lets just call her amanda. Both amanda and i and also my friends never met each other since 1 year ago, and until now we only talk to each other in our whatsapp gc, but one day, at 24 june 2023, she post something like this

"Ur thoughts on me?" on her whatsapp status, so i replied basically saying that she's like my big sister, and then she suddenly told us that she's moving, suddenly mood goes down, im getting even more sad , im already sad enough because of a girl and now i didnt even get to say goodbye irl to her? f

i swear i had enough of this shit, pls make  it stop

i lose somebody to talk to, somebody to say good morning, and goodnight, somebody to yell at me for playing games late at night, even though im still grateful i still have my mom, my dad, brother, friends, and all the people around me, but they're not always around me and not always avaiable for me

Like i said before, i just need somebody to talk to 24/7, i wanted to express all these and just talk to my mother, but both my parents are already stressing out thinking about this life, i dont want to bother them even more, they're already stressed enough to even think about dinner and problems in their life.

So i kept this for weeks on end, but thank god there's still somebody to talk to even though not always 24/7 but still to cheer me up, and to be there for me if they have time.

But all those people to cheer me up, still wasn't enough for my greedy mind and my ego
To me, it wasnt enough, i never ever experience loving, true loving except from my family and my besties, and i never ever experience something as dating and being somebody's boyfriend, but i do have an experience on just getting close to someone, getting very close, but suddenly being strangers 3 times, nobody loves me as i love them nobody except my family, parents, and my close friends. But like i said, it wasn't enough for my greedy-ass mind

1000 fucks isnt enough to remove this and express this sadness and angriness and dissapointment of myself

but one, girl is enough. I  know it sounds very weird but trust me, what i meant is someone close to me very very very very very close, close enough to even know my family dramas and problems.
close enough to talk to each other 24/7, and one more time like i said, thats the main reason im trying to get closer to her.


i lose her now, i regret it, If it ends like this, i should've just reject the offer, or maybe accept it but not trying to get closer to her. FUCK NGENTOT ANJING  KONTOLL TOLOL BANGET GW

IIm such  a dumbass, fuck i dont even know how to xpres this, i dont fucking  now how



Now im here, all alone, with no one except my friends on my side, but no more crazy conversations, i miss her very much im being honest, but now im just a clown, hoping that there'll be hope, even though thats probably not possible, but who knows?, maybe god says otherwise, maybe god is helping me but on another way, i dont know, god works on mysterious ways. Allahuakbar, but thanks to god, im nowhere near zina, but still, i feel very very lonely, i dont even know how to tell you how lonely i am.

25 june 2023, this is something i called a "wound", but if you forgot about this and the wound heals, i wanted you to remember that you're the one who scarred yourself even though it already heals.
