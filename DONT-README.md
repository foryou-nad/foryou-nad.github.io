Uhh, i dont know what to say rn, but ill tell you the updates.

As you might know, me and her, its not going so well, we're literally strangers now, well not really, but we acted like strangers.

We never talked to each other, and she didnt even want to view my insta story neither whatsapp story.

I don't know but i assume that im currently the main topic for the girls talk.
Keep in mind that its just an assume and i cant really prove it since i got no proof for that.

Now every morning im doing a small exercise to keep my body at least a little bit fit, because next semester i wanted to join the soccer club, to meet my friends/classmates, and to try to forget about her and her existence, or at least, the memories that we made.

Its impossible to truly 100% forget about her since we're still in the same school and class. So im going to meet her, every single fucking day. And i guess we wont talk again, not anymore.

Its 22:46 when i write these on July 5 2023, idk its been 2-3 weeks since we haven't talked. Im trying to move on and thankfully its getting better for my progress, even though i still hope for her to come back for me, to kept her promise, at least fix it since she already broke it. Im still waiting right here, because you said that you'll always be there to comfort me, for me, only me. 

Well that was a lie. She, didnt really kept here promise, and she goes away like it was nothing, after she broke my feelings and my heart, and im not trying to be the most gen z-est person and exaggerate this, but i literally mean it, im feeling more and more sad throughout my progress, I already have my own problems and now she's adding another?, wow what a kind and nice girl, i like it. Nah im just kidding, i actually dont.

But i aint gonna lie, i still miss the part where we're closer than ever.
