ITS MY FAULT ALL THIS HAPPENED
i regret my choice but its too late, i should've reject that offer from the very first time so all these won't happen, but on the other side, if all these didnt happen then im still playing with those guys and not these guys, which happens to be the good side of my choice, but FUCK FUCK THIS, IIM SUCH A NERD, A FUCKING LOSER, DISGRACE, FUCK.

If anybody read this, please i just need someone to talk to and express my feelings, the main reason i choose to try to get close to her, is not just getting her to like me and be my gf. The main reason is, i just need someone to talk to 24/7 even if its not irl, i just need someone to say "morning" and "goodnight" and to have someone very very close to me, and if im lucky maybe we can stay together until we're married and have a good life. I just need someone, close to me, someone that i can always rely on, someone that i can trust, sing together, having fun time together, not just someone that have a status as my gf to show it to bunch of people.

But of course, me being my fucking self, i did dumb things, and didnt even have the courage to talk or even look at her, and i cant even find a topic to keep our whatsapp conversation longer, cant even build the courage to talk to her even on whatsapp (sometimes), its all my fault. They say that its nobody's fault when it comes to loving, but in this case, its so obvious that its my fault, its my fault that we're now seeing each other as strangers, its my fault that we rarely talks to each other and its my fault we didnt have that conversation that lasts hours, its my fault that she didnt like me, its my fault that she hates me, its my fault that she wont talk to me again.


Its my fault, dont you dare say that its nobody's fault because the answer is so fucking obvious, all those shitty conversations, gone. No more "morning", "goodnight" or even "hi". FUCK FUUCK FUUCK, she said that she'll always be here for me, but the truth is, im the onee that made her forgot about that promise, im the one that made he break it, break the promise we made for each other.

Sometimes i think that she's just using me because she got nobody to talk to at the time, but sometimes it's my fault that made her like that. 

And hey to somebody who reads all these shit and come to the conclusion, thanks for listening or maybe reading?, idk, but thanks. We can have a conversation together at whatsapp if you wanted to.
